        <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire, and he passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. He made significant contributions to various aspects of theoretical physics and reshaped the way we understand the universe. Some key points about Einstein:
	<ul> 
	<li> Theory of Relativity:

	•	Special Theory of Relativity: Proposed in 1905, it introduced the famous equation E=mc², describing the equivalence of mass and energy.
	•	General Theory of Relativity: Presented in 1915, it fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity and space-time.

	</li>
	<li> Contributions to Physics:

	•	Photoelectric Effect: Worked on the explanation of the photoelectric effect, which contributed to the development of quantum theory.
	•	Brownian Motion: Provided evidence supporting the atomic theory by explaining the random movement of particles in a fluid.

	</li>
	<li> Humanitarian and Activism:

	•	Humanitarian Efforts: Advocated for pacifism, civil rights, and international cooperation.
	•	Political Involvement: Opposed Nazism and authoritarianism, which led him to immigrate to the United States during World War II.
		sonality: Known for her charm, intelligence, and persuasive skills.

	</li>
	<li> Legacy and Impact:

	•	Nobel Prize: Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on theoretical physics.
	•	Influence on Science: His theories continue to be the basis for modern physics, impacting fields such as cosmology, astronomy, and particle physics.

	</li>
	</ul>

Albert Einstein’s revolutionary theories transformed the scientific landscape and had a profound impact on the way we perceive and comprehend the universe. His scientific legacy and advocacy for peace and human rights continue to inspire scientists and individuals worldwide..</p>
